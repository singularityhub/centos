# CentOS

This is a library of CentOS builds for Singularity images hosted on Singularity Static Registry. The following standard applies:

 - each `Singularity` file corresponds to a build
 - tags are supported based on the extension of the Singularity file, with an extensionless file corresponding to "latest"
